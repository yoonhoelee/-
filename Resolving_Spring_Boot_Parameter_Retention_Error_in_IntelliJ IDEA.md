# Resolving Spring Boot Parameter Retention Error in IntelliJ IDEA

## The Problem

Recently, I encountered two related Spring Boot startup errors in IntelliJ IDEA that were particularly frustrating because the code itself was correct. Here are the errors I encountered:

### Error 1: Multiple Beans Found
```
***************************
APPLICATION FAILED TO START
***************************
Description:
Parameter 1 of constructor in com.genesisnest.module.logging.service.LoggingService required a single bean, but 2 were found:
    - adminActivityLogBaseRepository
    - adminActivityLogRepository

This may be due to missing parameter name information
```

### Error 2: Configuration Properties Binding Failure
```
***************************
APPLICATION FAILED TO START
***************************
Description:
Failed to bind properties under 'crypt.jpa' to com.genesisnest.module.crypt.spring.autoconfigure.jpa.CryptJpaProperties:
    Reason: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Unable to create instance
This may be due to missing parameter name information
```

Both errors included this crucial hint:
```
Ensure that your compiler is configured to use the '-parameters' flag.
You may need to update both your build tool settings as well as your IDE.
```

## The Root Cause

The root cause of these errors was a mismatch between the compiler settings in IntelliJ IDEA and Gradle. Spring Framework 6.x requires the `-parameters` compiler flag to be enabled for proper parameter name retention, which is crucial for:
- Dependency injection
- Configuration properties binding
- Parameter name resolution

## The Solution

The solution was surprisingly simple: changing the build/compile settings in IntelliJ IDEA to use Gradle instead of IntelliJ's built-in compiler.

### Steps to Fix:

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA
2. Go to `File` → `Settings` (or `IntelliJ IDEA` → `Preferences` on macOS)
3. Navigate to `Build, Execution, Deployment` → `Build Tools` → `Gradle`
4. Find the `Build and run using` setting
5. Change it from `IntelliJ IDEA` to `Gradle`
6. Apply the changes and restart your IDE

## Alternative Solutions

While changing the compiler to Gradle worked for me, there are other approaches you could try:

1. **Add the -parameters flag to IntelliJ's compiler:**
   - Go to `File` → `Settings` → `Build, Execution, Deployment` → `Compiler` → `Java Compiler`
   - Add `-parameters` to "Additional command line parameters"

2. **Configure it in build.gradle:**
   ```groovy
   compileJava {
       options.parameters = true
   }
   ```

3. **Configure it in pom.xml (if using Maven):**
   ```xml
   <plugin>
       <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
       <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
       <configuration>
           <parameters>true</parameters>
       </configuration>
   </plugin>
   ```

## Why This Matters

This issue is particularly relevant for Spring Boot applications using Spring Framework 6.x, where parameter name retention is crucial for proper dependency injection and configuration binding. The `-parameters` flag ensures that parameter names are preserved in the compiled bytecode, which Spring uses for various features.

## Lessons Learned

1. When using Spring Framework 6.x, ensure proper compiler settings are configured
2. IDE settings can sometimes override or conflict with build tool settings
3. When encountering mysterious Spring Boot startup errors, check compiler configurations
4. Using the build tool's compiler (Gradle/Maven) instead of IDE's built-in compiler can help ensure consistency
